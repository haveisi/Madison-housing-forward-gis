# Madison-housing-forward-gis– Madison, WI

This project applies GIS and LEED-informed performance concepts to evaluate where Madison’s Housing Forward zoning reforms (duplexes, ADUs, mid-scale infill) are most likely to deliver public benefit.

## Purpose
Zoning reform determines where housing can be built. Building performance and location efficiency determine how well housing serves residents over time. This analysis integrates both lenses to support policy discussion.

## Methods
Census tracts were evaluated using four indicators:
- Affordability pressure (normalized median household income)
- Housing age (share of housing built before 1980)
- Location efficiency (proximity to transit and essential services)
- Zoning eligibility for missing-middle housing

Indicators were normalized (0–1) and combined into a composite Opportunity Index. Tracts were classified into High, Moderate, and Lower opportunity categories.

## Tools
- ArcGIS Pro (spatial analysis, joins, indexing)
- U.S. Census ACS 5-year estimates
- City of Madison Open Data
- LEED Location & Transportation and Energy principles (conceptual alignment)

## Outputs
- Policy-ready map (PDF)
- Preview map (PNG)
- Processed geodatabase with final opportunity layers

## Applications
- Local housing policy analysis
- Sustainable community planning
- LEED-informed decision support
- 
## Relevance
This analysis demonstrates how LEED principles (Location & Transportation, Energy & Atmosphere, and Indoor Environmental Quality) can inform housing and land-use policy at the neighborhood scale.
